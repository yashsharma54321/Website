        <b>
            First things first <br>
            I'ma say all the words inside my head <br>
            I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh <br>
            The way that things have been, oh-ooh <br>
            <br>
            Second things second<br>
            Don't you tell me what you think that I could be <br>
            I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh <br>
            The master of my sea, oh-ooh <br>
            <br>
            [Pre-Chorus] <br>
            I was broken from a young age <br>
            Taking my sulking to the masses <br>
            Writing my poems for the few <br>
            That look to me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me <br>
            Singing from heartache from the pain <br>
            Taking my message from the veins <br>
            Speaking my lesson from the brain <br>
            Seeing the beauty through the... <br>
            <br>
            [Chorus] <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You break me down and build me up, believer, believer <br>
            Pain! <br>
            Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain <br>
            My life, my love, my drive, it came from... <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br>
            <br>
            [Verse 2] <br>
            Third things third <br>
            Send a prayer to the ones up above <br>
            All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh <br>
            Your spirit up above, oh-ooh <br>
            <br>
            [Pre-Chorus 2] <br>
            I was choking in the crowd <br>
            Building my rain up in the cloud <br>
            Falling like ashes to the ground <br>
            Hoping my feelings, they would drown <br>
            But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing <br>
            Inhibited, limited <br>
            Till it broke open and rained down <br>
            And rained down, like... <br>
            <br>
            [Chorus] <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You break me down and build me up, believer, believer <br>
            Pain! <br>
            Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain <br>
            My life, my love, my drive, it came from... <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br>
            <br>
            [Bridge] <br>
            Last things last <br>
            By the grace of the fire and the flame <br>
            You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh <br>
            The blood in my veins, oh-ooh <br>
            But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing <br>
            Inhibited, limited <br>
            Till it broke open and rained down <br>
            And rained down, like... <br>
            <br>
            [Chorus] <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You break me down and build me up, believer, believer <br>
            Pain! <br>
            Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain <br>
            My life, my love, my drive, it came from... <br>
            Pain! <br>
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br>
